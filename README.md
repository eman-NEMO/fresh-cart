#  E-commerce Application

 ## fully functional single-page e-commerce application using React.js, and pre-existing backend. I implemented the following key features:

1- User Registration & Login with Form Validation.
2- Home Page with the ability to add products to the cart and view product details.
3- Cart Page to display and manage the products added by the user.
4- Wishlist functionality for users to favourite their preferred products.
5- Categories and Brands for efficient product categorization.
6- Product search functionality to help users find specific items.
7- Online payment methods for user convenience.
8- Notifications for updates and alerts.
9- Offline mode detection to ensure a seamless user experience.
10- Handling authentication and authorization.
I utilized tools like Bootstrap and React libraries such as react router dom, formik, yup, react slick, React toastify, React Helmet, React Query, and Axios for API calls. Additionally, I ensured a responsive design that aligned seamlessly with the backend data
